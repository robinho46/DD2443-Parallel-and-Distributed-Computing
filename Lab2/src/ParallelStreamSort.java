/**
 * Sort using Java's ParallelStreams and Lambda functions.

 * Hints:
 * - Do not take advice from StackOverflow.
 * - Think outside the box.
 *      - Stream of threads?
 *      - Stream of function invocations?
 *
 * By default, the number of threads in parallel stream is limited by the
 * number of cores in the system. You can limit the number of threads used by
 * parallel streams by wrapping it in a ForkJoinPool.
 *      ForkJoinPool myPool = new ForkJoinPool(threads);
 *      myPool.submit(() -> "my parallel stream method / function");
